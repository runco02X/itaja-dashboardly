// Since this is a read-only file that we can't modify directly, 
// we need to tell the user about the issue with the translation key.
// The error shows that the key "viewLatestTransactions" is not assignable
// to the TranslationKey type, which means it doesn't exist in the
// translations file.

// We should advise the user to update their translations file to include
// this missing key, or to change the key in project-payment-logs.tsx
// to an existing one like "viewAll" instead.
